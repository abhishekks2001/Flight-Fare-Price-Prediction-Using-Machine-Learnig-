# Flight-Fare-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The "Flight Fare Price Prediction" project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to accurately forecast the price of flight tickets, thereby assisting travelers in making informed decisions about their travel expenses. With the rapid expansion of the Indian aviation industry and the increasing number of operational airports, the demand for reliable flight fare prediction models has grown significantly.

The objective of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate predictive model leveraging historical flight data and machine learning algorithms. By employing XGBoost Regressor, the model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 88.4%. Additionally, user input functionality is integrated into the project, allowing travelers to input their specific requirements and receive personalized fare predictions.

The relevance of this project lies in its ability to provide travelers with valuable insights into airfare costs, enabling better budget planning and decision-making. By empowering consumers with accurate forecasts, the project enhances the overall user experience and contributes to transparency and efficiency within the air travel ecosystem.

In addition to model development, the project includes comprehensive data cleaning and visualization processes to ensure data quality and facilitate insights generation. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, key patterns, trends, and relationships within the flight data are identified, providing additional context for the predictive model.

Overall, the Flight Fare Price Prediction project serves as a valuable tool for both travelers and the aviation industry, offering actionable insights, improved decision-making capabilities, and enhanced user satisfaction in the realm of air travel.
